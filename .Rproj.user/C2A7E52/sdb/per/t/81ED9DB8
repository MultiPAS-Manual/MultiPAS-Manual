In the case of the latter, exit LabVIEW completely and reset the PAS by turning off the main power switch on the control box *and* disconnecting the USB cable.  Reconnect and restart.\n1. *VISA Read/Write: Device is valid but VISA cannot open it.*  Another program is communicating with one of the PAS's components.  Close other programs and restart LabVIEW.\n1. *Valve will not switch and/or frequencies will not change.*  USB communication broken -- exit LabVIEW completely and reset the PAS by turning off the main power switch on the control box *and* disconnecting the USB cable.  Reconnect and restart.\n1. *WaveIO Device Not Found.*  Known bug with unknown cause.  To fix, stop the program, increase the PD and mic device ID's (under the Utilities tab) by 1 and start the program.  Then, stop the program, set them back to their original values and start the program again.  The errors should go away after the final restart.\n1. *Extremely fast aquisition (x-axis) on PD or mic plots.*  See *WaveIO Device Not Found*, above.\n\n## Common Hardware Errors\n1. *No Signal or Excessive Noise.*  Excessive noise or a cancellation of signal may occur if:\n    - *There is an opening on the PAS cell.*  Make sure the inlet and outlet are attached to the control box, a gas line, or plugged; check all fittings on the PAS cell to ensure they are tight.\n    - *The pump is not set correctly or the orifice is missing.* Lower the pump speed with the trim pot on the pump and check that the orifice is in place.\n    - *The flow rate is too high.*  Lower the flow rate.\n1.  *High Background.*  The cell may be dirty.  See [Cleaning the PAS](maintainance.html#cleaning-the-pas).\n1.  *Low Laser Powers.*  Low laser power may be observed if:\n    - *The multipass alignment is bad.*  [Align](maintainance.html#realignment) the multipass cell.\n    - *The optics are dirty.* [Clean the optics.](maintainance.html#cleaning-the-optics)\n    - *The optics are misaligned* Go through the [realigment](maintainance.html#realignment) procedure.",
